# Project Documentation

## Project Overview

The project is an interactive Number Guessing Game where the user tries to guess a randomly generated number between 1 and 100. The game provides real-time feedback based on the user's guess, such as "Too high!", "Too low!", or "Correct!" when the user guesses the right number. The number of attempts is tracked and displayed. Once the user correctly guesses the number, a "Play Again" button appears, allowing the user to restart the game and try again.
